Campus Placement Prediction Project

Campus Placement Prediction Project Description The "Campus Placement Prediction" project aims to predict whether students will be placed during campus recruitment drives based on their academic and extracurricular data. It employs machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model and provides a Flask-based web application for users to input their data and receive placement predictions.

Features Predictive Model: Uses machine learning to forecast campus placement outcomes. Web Interface: Flask application for interactive data input and prediction. User Input Form: Allows students to enter their details and view predictions. Technologies Python: Programming language Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, LightGBM Web Framework: Flask Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy Model Serialization: Pickle Front-End: HTML/CSS Installation Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.

Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment for the project.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file.

Model File: Ensure the model.pkl file is present in the project directory. If not, you may need to train the model.

Running the Application Start the Flask Application: Run the Flask application to start the server.

Access the Web Application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the application.

Usage Home Page: Enter student details in the provided form. Results Page: Submit the form to see the prediction of whether the student is likely to be placed. Troubleshooting Missing Model File: Ensure that model.pkl is correctly placed in the project directory. Dependency Issues: Verify that all necessary packages are installed and properly configured. Future Enhancements Advanced Features: Implement data visualizations and deeper analytics. User Authentication: Add user authentication for personalized access. Model Improvement: Explore advanced machine learning techniques and model optimization. License This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.
